Welcome to Debugging Data: a blog focusing on addressing common questions and providing tricks and tips for projects in R, SQL and other languages. Our goal for Debugging Data is to help everyone from those just learning to output 'hello world' to those who have been programming before the first Iphone was released. 

Three years ago, we both graduated from UCLA  and started working at the same consulting firm in LA. Fast forward to today and although we work at different firms and on different types of projects we still enjoy learning new tricks and sharing tips in multiple programming languages. We're excited to answer your questions (as well as our own) about data analytics as well as play around and explore data and new languages!
