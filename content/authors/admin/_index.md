Welcome everyone! We are Amy and Nellie, two graduates from UCLA (go bruins) working as data analytic consultants.Although we now work at different firms and on different types of projects, we both enjoy learning new tricks and tips in multiple programming languages and are hoping to built a site where we answer common questions, show some cool things you can do with data and explore new langauges and analyses!
