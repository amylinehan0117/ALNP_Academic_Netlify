Three years ago, we both graduated from UCLA (go bruins!) and started working at the same consulting firm in LA. Fast forward to today and although we work at different firms and on different types of projects we still enjoy learning new tricks and sharing tips in multiple programming languages. We're excited to answer your questions (as well as our own) about data analytics as well as play around and explore data and new languages!
