Welcome to Debugging Data: a blog focusing on addressing common questions and providing tricks and tips for projects in R, SQL and other languages. Three years ago, we both graduated from UCLA  and started working at the same consulting firm in LA. Fast forward to today and although we work at different firms and on different types of projects we still enjoy learning new tricks and sharing tips in multiple programming languages. Our goal for Debugging Data is to help everyone from beginners to advanced programmers so thanks for being here!
