<p>If you’ve ever taken a stats/econ/math class, the phrase “normal distribution” probably rings a bell for you (pun definitely intended). Also known as the bell curve, the probably density function of the normal distribution occurs often in society/nature/the world. There are about a million different defintions to describe this distribution on the world wide web but my favorite is a stats definition that describes the normal distribution as “a probability function that describes how the values of a variable are distributed. It is a symmetric distribution where most of the observations cluster around the central peak and the probabilities for values further away from the mean taper off equally in both directions” (<a href="https://statisticsbyjim.com/basics/normal-distribution/" class="uri">https://statisticsbyjim.com/basics/normal-distribution/</a>). This definition highlights that the function centers around the mean/average of the values and hence the highest point in the graph is the mean.</p>
<p>I’m not going to dive into the mathemtical functions and reasoning behind the normal distribution or probably density functions in this post. If you’re interested in that I recommend reviewing the Woflram Alpha page (or just google normal distribution there is so much information you can dive into) <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/NormalDistribution.html" class="uri">https://mathworld.wolfram.com/NormalDistribution.html</a>.</p>
<p>In R, the stats package contains four functions for the Normal Distribution. For the complete documentation, just type “?rnorm” into your R console. R has four functions pertaining to the normal distribution and each return a different aspect of a distribution:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Function</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>dnorm(x, mean = 0, sd = 1, log = FALSE)</td>
<td>Returns the density</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd =1)</td>
<td>Returns random deviates</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>pnrom(q, mean = 0, sd = 1, lower.tail = TRUE, log.p = FALSE)</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
