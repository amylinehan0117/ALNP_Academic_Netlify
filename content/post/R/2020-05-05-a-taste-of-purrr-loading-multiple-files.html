<p>When you have multiple files you need to load into R, each to their own objects, you can use purrr to avoid writing <em>object_name &lt;- read.table(filepath)</em> over and over again.</p>
<p>Purrr is a very nifty library in R that provides tools to manipulate lists in R. For this example, we’ll use <em>map()</em> and <em>assign()</em>.</p>
<p>Let’s go through the steps:</p>
<div id="make-a-vector-of-file-names" class="section level3">
<h3>1) Make a vector of file names</h3>
<p>These should be your filepaths</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)
filepaths &lt;-  c(
  &quot;file1.csv&quot;,
  &quot;file2.csv&quot;,
  &quot;file3.csv&quot;
) 
# We&#39;re adding the names of the files as the names of each of the filepaths
filepaths &lt;- filepaths %&gt;% set_names(nm = basename(.) %&gt;% tools::file_path_sans_ext())</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="read-in-the-files-to-create-a-list-of-data-frames" class="section level3">
<h3>2) Read in the files to create a list of data frames</h3>
<p>This will read in the data frame in the file path and name it the name from above</p>
<pre class="r"><code>files &lt;- purrr::map(filepaths, read_csv)</code></pre>
<p>Now we have a list of processed dataframes!</p>
</div>
<div id="save-each-object-in-the-list-to-its-own-variable-name" class="section level3">
<h3>3) Save each object in the list to it’s own variable name</h3>
<p>If you want to work with these objects separately in R, you may want them each saved as a separate data frame
pmap is purrr’s function for mapping several variable to a function. <em>.l</em> is the list of parameters which are named <em>.x</em>, <em>.y</em>, etc. <em>.f</em> is the function which will be applied to the parameters (see <a href="https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/">RStudio’s purrr cheatsheet for more information</a> for more information.)</p>
<p>It’s very important we set the environment to <em>.GlobalEnv</em>, because otherwise the objects won’t show up in our environmnet!</p>
<pre class="r"><code>purrr::pmap(.l = list(.x = names(files), .y = files), .f = ~assign(.x, .y, envir = .GlobalEnv))</code></pre>
</div>
