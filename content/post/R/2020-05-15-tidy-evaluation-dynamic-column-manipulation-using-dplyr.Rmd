When it comes to R, the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) is my dream land. I often have the problem where I want to write a fuction to manipulate data frames, but can't figure out a good way to pass field names to a function and be able to run dplyr code on it. 

I know there are some workarounds to this in base R, but I recently started learning about [tidy evaluation](https://tidyeval.tidyverse.org/). It's a pretty simple framework in R that allows you to functionalize dplyr commands.

The documentation for this framework is extensive and I suggest reading it. I am going to examples of this that have worked for me here.

#### Add a column to a dataframe
In this example, I create a function that adds a lagged version of any column in a dataframe to the dataframe.
```{r}
suppressMessages(library(tidyverse))

add_lag_field <- function(df, col) {
  # define new field name
  var_name = paste0(col,"_lag")
  return(df %>% mutate(
    !!sym(var_name) := lag(!!sym(col))
    )
  )
}

head(add_lag_field(iris, "Sepal.Width"))
```
